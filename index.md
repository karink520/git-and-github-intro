## Description

The goal of this workshop is to introduce students to the concepts and practice of Bayesian modeling.   We will begin by motivating Bayesian approaches.  Next,  we will introduce and apply models with conjugate priors,  such as Bayesian normal,  Bayesian binomial,  and Bayesian linear regression.   We will then introduce the two primary techniques for approximate Bayesian inference,  namely Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference.    Using these techniques,  and in some cases clever trickery,  we will then tackle models for which there are not conjugate priors,  such as Bayesian logistic regression,  Bayesian multiclass regression,  Bayesian mixture models,  and Bayesian hidden Markov models.  Finally,  we will very briefly discuss Bayesian deep learning.    For applications,  we will use Python; namely,  a combination of  pymc3,  scikit-learn,  and code we write ourselves.

## Exercises

### Philosophy

Why have exercises as a part of the course, as opposed to just further lecture?

* Working actively with the material will help you to better understand it, find good questions to ask, 
and be better prepared for the next sections.

Why have a lab as a part of the course, as opposed to just working on your own time? 

* Opportunity to collaborate in groups.
* Get real-time feedback from instructors.
